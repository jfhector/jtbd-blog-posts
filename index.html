        How to Design Things That People Want
        <br>Part 1: Jobs-to-be-Done in plain language
    </h1>

    <p>Today I want to talk to you about how to design things that people actually want – as opposed to designing things that people don't actually end up being bothered about.</p>
    
    <p>It's about using a method called Jobs-to-be-Done.</p>
    
    <h2>We need to better articulate user-centred design, and why it matters</h2>

    <p>Have you ever been in situations like these?</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A situation where a client or a colleague says "We don't have time for user research or user testing, because we need to build more features"?</li>
        <li>Or a situation where you hear "[Stakeholder Name] preferred the previous designs. So, let's all revert back to how things were before"?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>It's inevitable that some people won't understand or value user-centred design as user researchers or user-experience designers people would like them to.</p>
    
    <p>And that's a good thing. We all have different priorities and different skills.</p>
    
    <p>But I must admit, I used to feel quite afraid of situations like this. Because I didn't know how to handle them.</p>
    
    <p>I think that it's actually on us – user researchers, designers and product managers – to articulate our process and thinking more clearly, so that we can bring other people along with us.</p>
    
    <h3>Jobs-to-be-Done helps people understand the process of user-centred design</h3>

    <p>Jobs-to-be-Done is not a silver bullet that's going to replace all your other ways of thinking or methods. But it's very useful for communicating and articulating user-centred design, and bringing other people along with us.</p>
    
    <p>And in a nutshell, <strong>Jobs-to-be-Done is a powerful way of thinking that puts people's real situations of struggle, and the outcomes that they're hoping for, at the centre of every conversation.</strong></p>
    
    <p>This is a lot better than having feature ideas or stakeholders' feature preferences at the centre of conversations.</p>
    
    <h3>Explaining Jobs-to-be-Done in plain language</h3>

    <p>If you're new to Jobs-to-be-Done, you could spend the next few weeks reading about it online, and you'll probably end up being quite confused.</p>
    
    <p>There are broadly two ways of doing Jobs-to-be-Done. What I'm talking to you about today, is the original vision. The way that the creators defined it. Which I think is the most interesting and the newest. Everything else is also useful.</p>
    
    <p>If you hear a client talk about Jobs-to-be-Done a bit like a Job-to-be-Done is a task, this is useful. But Jobs-to-be-Done, the way that Clay Christensen and Bob Moesta defined it, is different and more subtle than that.</p>
    
    <p>My goal today is to take Jobs-to-be-Done, and translate into plain language, without any jargon, that you can use with your clients and colleagues. You won't even need to use the words "Jobs" or "Jobs-to-be-Done", because they confuse people.</p>
    
    <p>I'm going to boil Jobs-to-be-Done down to 2 simple ideas, and 3 habits that you can use on your projects. And if you use these habits on your projects, you'll immediately notice a difference, without needing to ask your clients or colleagues to learn a new method or change the way they think.</p>

    <h2>Jobs-to-be-Done in two key ideas</h2>

    <h3>
        Idea #1:
        <br>People don't want products, services or features.
        <br> People want to go from a situation of struggle to outcomes they're hoping for
    </h3>
    
    <p>The first idea of Jobs-to-be-Done is that, people don't actually want products, features or services. What people want, actually, is to get from a situation of struggle that they're in, to the outcomes that they're imagining.</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes we are in situations of struggle: a situation where you might be stressed, or worried, or unhappy, dissatisfied, bored, ... You don't really like that situation. You want to get rid of these feelings.</p>
    
    <p>And as you are into that situation, you're also imagining a different state of things, a different set of outcomes.</p>

    <img alt="People are in situations of struggle, and they imagine outcomes they're hoping for." class="slide" loading="lazy" src="assets/p1-idea1.jpeg">

    <p>So, people experience situations of struggle, and as they do, they hope for different outcomes.</p>
    
    <p>Products, services and features are just one possible way might help them go from that situation of struggle to the outcomes that they're hoping for.</p>
    
    <p>But products, services or features are quite secondary. It's not the what matters the most. What is most real and most important to people, are the struggle and the difficult feelings that they're feeling, and the outcomes that they're hoping to achieve.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What people really want, is not your product, service or feature. What they really want is to get out of their situation of struggle, and closer to the outcomes they're hoping for.</strong></p>
    
    <h4>Example: struggling to focus on work</h4>
    
    <p>For example, if you hear me say "I want coffee", it's not like I'm lying to you, but there's actually a lot more going on than I'm telling you.</p>
    
    <img alt="A situation of struggle in which I sometimes use coffee. Description just below." class="slide" loading="lazy" src="assets/p1-idea1-eg.jpeg">

    <p>My housemate plays video games late at night in the room just above me. So sometimes in the office, without having slept well. I struggle to focus and get motivated to do the work I'm supposed to be doing.</p>
    
    <p>The more I procrastinate, the more anxious I feel, and the more guilty I feel.</p>
    
    <p>When this happens, I really want to get rid of these feelings and this situation. And I'm hoping that I'll manage to focus on my work, and that my work will be done to good standards by 6pm, so that I don't have a stressful evening or another incomplete night of sleep.</p>
    
    <p>These outcomes very important to me. These are the things that really matter to me.</p>
    
    <p>I've used a few different products or strategies at different times when I've been in this situation of struggle:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sometimes I get a cup of coffee. But if I've already had two coffees on the same day, then the third coffee actually makes things worse. So sometimes coffee isn't right.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, I might go to the park down the street, and have a nap on the grass. That's my favourite method. But it's not always sunny, and the grass is not always dry. So I can't use it all the time.</li>
        <li>When I can't have a nap, I might go somewhere and meditate for 10 minutes or 15 minutes. When I come back and I'm able to focus a bit better.</li>
        <li>But sometimes I feel I don't have time to do this. If I can't have a coffee, take a nap or meditate, then I try to delegate. If I can't delegate I revert to procrastination.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>It doesn't really matter to me which of these methods I pick. What I really want is to not be in that situation of struggle any more, not feel these difficult feelings, make progress towards these outcomes that I want.</p>
    
    <p>So, people don't actually want products, services and features. What they really want instead is to get from a situation of struggle that they're feeling and experiencing to outcomes they're hoping to achieve.</p>
    
    <p>That's the first idea of Jobs-to-be-Done.</p>

    <h3>
        Idea #2
        <br>Focusing on features makes design hard.
        <br> Focusing on situations of struggle and desired outcomes makes design much easier
    </h3>

    <p>The second idea of Jobs-to-be-Done is that focusing on feature ideas makes design hard.</p>

    <p>Instead, if you focus on the situations of struggle that people are experiencing, and on the outcomes that they are hoping to achieve, then your design process is going to be way easier.</p>
    
    <h4>A simple four-step design process</h4>

    <img alt="A four-step design process. Described just below" class="slide" loading="lazy" src="assets/p1-idea2.jpeg">

    <p>When you focus on situations of struggle and desired outcomes (as opposed to feature ideas) the design process at a high level is pretty simple.</p>
    
    <p>It boils down to four simple questions:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            "What are our customers specific situations of struggle?".
        </li>

        <li>
            "What outcomes are potential users hoping to achieve, when they are in this situation of struggle?"
        </li>

        <li>
            "What solutions (i.e. things, product, services, strategies are they currently using when they are in this situation of struggle, trying to achieve these outcomes?"
        </li>

        <li>
            "Can we make that quicker, can we make that easier, or better in some ways, to get from that situation of struggle to that desired outcome?".
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>These are the four questions I always have in my head when I design. It's pretty easy to communicate to clients, and very helpful to structure conversations.</p>
